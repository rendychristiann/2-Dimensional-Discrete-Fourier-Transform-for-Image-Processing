2D DTFT of an Image for Image Processing using MATLAB
 
This project is an implementation of the 2D Discrete Fourier Transform on existing images using filtering in the MATLAB program.

To run the program, save the program file and image "butterfly_512" in the same file directory and import the image to the program according to the location of the image file.
